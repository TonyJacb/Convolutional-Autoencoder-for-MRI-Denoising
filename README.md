# Convolutional-Autoencoder-for-MRI-Denoising
This project does a comparison between existing denoising methods<br>
<br>
## 1. MATLAB and the Deep Learning Toobox
The denoising neural network (dnCNN) found in the Deep Learning Toolbox was used. A comparative study with a Wiener filter and dnCNN was performed over a noisy MR Image.The Wiener filter was of a kernel size of (5,5)
